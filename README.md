The Countdown Timer is a simple yet effective desktop application built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Pygame for sound playback. This application allows users to set a countdown timer by entering hours, minutes, and seconds. Once the timer reaches zero, it plays a sound to alert the user that the time is up.
